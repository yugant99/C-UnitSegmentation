### **2. Side-by-Side Comparison Examples**

**INPUT (Raw Descript):**
```
[00:00:00] P: Hi Nala, I'm [redacted], I'm your nurse today.
[00:00:12] Av: Uh, oh, hi, I don't know you, I don't need help.
```

**OUR SYSTEM OUTPUT:**
```
VR_Falcon
-0:00
P: Hi Nala, I'm {redacted}, I'm your nurse today.
; :12
Av: (Uh [FP]), (oh [FP]), hi, I don't know you, I don't need help.
```

**MANUAL GOLD STANDARD:**
```
VR_Falcon (after)
-0:00 
P: Hi Nala, I'm {Redacted}. 
P: I'm your nurse today. 
; :02 
Av: Oh, hi. 
Av: I don't know you. 
Av: No. I don't need help.
```
