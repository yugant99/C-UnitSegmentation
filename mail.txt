Hi Raheleh and Yugant,

 

I apologize for the delay in sending over our transcripts from our Be EPIC-VR VR assessments.

 

Based on our discussion during our June meeting, I have collected three different transcripts from conversations with James or Nala for Yugant to review.

 

The goal was to write a program that supports the process of orthographic and C-unit segmentation transcription based on raw transcripts (e.g., from Descript or any other software). I have attached our SALT-specific formatting guidelines for this type of data. Please note that we do not need to apply a very detailed SALT coding convention for our data.   

 

One transcript is the raw version created with Descript, and the second transcript includes completed orthography and segmentation. Our CompSci student developed a program for this work using Pythonâ€™s PyCharm Community tool.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information.

 

Best,

Annette
