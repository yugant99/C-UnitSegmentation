SALT Transcription & C-Unit Segmentation Requirements (CARE Lab)

Source: CARE Lab SALT Transcription & C-Unit Segmentation Guide (attached).
Scope: Enumerate all rules required for orthographic transcription and C-unit segmentation.

1) Transcript Header & Identifiers
- Speaker codes: $Av = Avatar, $P = Participant. Place at the top to identify speakers.
- Header lines marked with "+":
  + Language: English (or applicable language)
  + ParticipantId: (name of file)
  + Context: Assessment vignette, Be EPIC-VR
  + Date and initials of Verbal Transcription: DD/MM/YYYY
  + Date and initials of Nonverbal Transcription: DD/MM/YYYY
  + Date and initials of FINAL Transcription: DD/MM/YYYY
- Concomitant behaviours noted at the beginning using + lines (vocal quality, distracting sounds, breathing, sighs, whistles, etc.).
- Comment lines: Use "=" at line start for transcriber comments (not analyzed).

2) Time Markers
- Use "- 0:00" at the beginning of the transcript.
- Include end time marker at transcript end: "- X:XX".

3) Speaker & Nonverbal Coding
- Verbal utterances: prefix with speaker label and colon, e.g., "Av:" or "P:".
- Nonverbal behaviours with communicative intent: place inside braces {} within the utterance.
  Example: P: Hi Linda {PN: gently touches Av's shoulder. AvN: smiles}
- If giving contextual information (scene-setting) rather than a coded nonverbal, do NOT use a colon after the speaker tag inside the braces.
  Correct: {Av laying in bed}
  Incorrect: {Av: laying in bed}
- Timing of nonverbal codes:
  - If nonverbal happens concurrently with speech, keep code on the same line.
  - If nonverbal occurs after the speech segment, put the nonverbal code on the next line, still within {}.

4) Pauses
- Intra-utterance pause (within same speaker’s c-unit): use ":". If ≥ 2 seconds, include rounded duration, e.g., ":05".
  Example: P: My name is Brenda :05 from VON.
  For ~1.5–1.9 second pauses within an utterance, use ":" immediately before the next word.
  Example: P: Do you want the blue shirt :or the red shirt?
- Inter-utterance pause (between utterances of Av or P): use ";". If ≥ 2 seconds, include rounded duration, e.g., "; :03".
  Example:
    P: Do you want to get up
    ; :05
    P: and get some breakfast?
- If there is a ~1.5–1.9s pause between utterances of the same speaker, use ":" at the start of the next c-unit (not ";").
  Example:
    P: Do you want to get up
    P: :and eat some breakfast?
- Durations ≥ 2.0s: round to nearest second; round up at half-second.
  Examples: 2.3s → :02; 1.5s → :02.

5) End of Utterance Punctuation (at end of each c-unit)
- Period "." for statements/comments. Do not use a period for abbreviations.
- Exclamation "!" for surprise/exclamation.
- Question mark "?" for questions.

6) Overlap & Abandonment
- Overlapping speech: use angle brackets <> around overlapping segments at both places.
  Example: P: Do you want <apples> Av: <yes>
- Abandoned utterance: use ">" at end when speaker does not complete thought and is not interrupted.
  Example:
    Av: and then she>
    Av: I want dinner.
  Distinguish from mazes (revisions) which are coded with parentheses ().

7) Unintelligible Speech
- X marks an unintelligible word (e.g., Av: The man is read/ing the X newspaper.)
- XX marks an unintelligible segment of unspecified length.
- XXX marks an entirely unintelligible utterance.

8) Mazes, Interjections, and Filled Pauses
- Mazes (filled pauses, false starts, repetitions, reformulations, interjections) are enclosed in parentheses ().
  General rule: Removing the maze content should leave a grammatical remainder that can stand alone as the c-unit.
- Revisions/reformulations: If there is a similar start to the c-unit and a revised continuation, the revised portions remain in (). The final intended form appears outside ().
  Example: Av: The (woma*) (:man) woman went to the store.
- Interjections may be included in mazes as appropriate.
- Filled pauses: annotate within mazes using [FP].
  Example: Av: The (uh [FP]) boy jump/ed up on the table.
  Typical filled pauses include: "uh", "um", "hm", "er", "like", "ah", etc.

9) Omissions, Partial Words, Bound Morphemes
- Use an asterisk after one or more initial letters to indicate an unfinished word.
  Example: Av: The (w*) man got up from the chair.
- Use an asterisk before a word to indicate an obligatory but omitted word/part of speech.
  Examples:
    Av: Give it *to me.
    Av: *SUBJ went to the store.  (Use *DET, *SUBJ, *VERB, *COP, *AUX to indicate type.)
- Use "/*" to indicate an omitted bound morpheme.
  Example: Av: The car go/*s fast.

10) Morphological Marking
- Use "/" notation to mark bound morphemes (inflectional endings) on verbs and other words.
  Examples:
    Av: When the boy look/ed in the jar he saw that the frog was missing.
    Av: The (uh [FP]) boy jump/ed up on the table.
    Av: The wife pack/ed her bag.
    Av: She crash/ed the car into a tree.
- This marking helps identify grammatical morphemes for linguistic analysis.

11) Linked Words
- Use underscore "_" to link multiple words that should be treated as a single token (e.g., titles, proper names, repeated phrases).
  Examples: fire_truck; Mr_Frog; %woof_woof.

12) Sound Effects
- Use percent sign "%" to identify sound effects.
  Example: Av: The dog said %woof_woof.

13) Special Symbols
- Use "^" to indicate incomplete utterances that trail off (different from abandoned utterances marked with ">").
  Example: P: Can I walk you down to the ^
- This typically occurs when speech fades out or is cut off by external factors.

14) Spelling & Lexical Conventions (accepted forms)
- Affirmative: okay, ok, yeah, yup, yes
- Negative: no, nope, nah
- Concatenatives: gonna, gotta, wanna, hafta, oughta, betcha
- Numbers: 21 or twentyone
- Other: ain't, oh, uhoh, oops, ooh, huh, hmm

15) C-Unit Definition
- A C-unit (communication unit): an independent (main) clause with all its modifiers.
- Includes the main clause with all subordinate clauses attached to it.
- Cannot be further divided without losing meaning.
- A clause contains a subject (noun phrase) and a predicate (verb phrase).
  Examples:
    Main clause only: Av: The wife was angry.
    Main + subordinate: Av: When the boy look/ed in the jar he saw that the frog was missing.

16) C-Unit Segmentation Rules
- Coordinating conjunctions: Split into two c-units when linking two main clauses.
  Coordinators include: and, or, but, so (not "so that"), and then.
  Example:
    Av: The wife pack/ed her bag.
    Av: and she left him.
- Subordinating conjunctions: Keep main + subordinate clause together as one c-unit.
  Subordinators include: because, that, when, who, after, before, so that, which, although, if, unless, while, as, how, until, like, where, since.
  Example: Av: She came back because she crash/ed the car into a tree.
- "So" can be coordinating or subordinating:
  - Coordinating unless meaning is "so that" (purpose), then subordinating.
  Examples:
    Coordinating: Av: They were happy again. Av: So they lived happily ever after.
    Subordinating (purpose): Av: He had to call the insurance company so the car would get fix/ed.
- Yes/No/Okay responses: When a speaker responds with yes/no/okay, treat as a separate c-unit.
  Example: P: Are you finished? Av: Yeah.
- Conjunction-reduced (CONJRED): Recognize reduced conjunctions that omit the subject but retain a verb referring to the prior subject.
  - Treat as a new c-unit when it begins with "and" but lacks a new subject.
  - Per 2023 update: DO NOT add the *CONJRED code tag; only segment appropriately.
  Example:
    Av: The wife went up to her room.
    Av: and pack/ed her bag.
- Do NOT split the c-unit for a conjunction joining two nouns within a clause.
  Example: Av: I want to wear the red shirt and blue pants.
- Tags and questions as tags: Phrases like "you know", "I guess", "I mean" are not segmented as separate c-units; keep them within the utterance.
  Examples:
    Statement with tag: Av: She smash/ed the car into the tree I guess.
    Question with tag: Av: She went out the door right?
- Dialogue quotes:
  - Dialogue embedded within an utterance counts as one c-unit.
  - Successive main clauses within dialogue quotes are counted as separate c-units.
  Example: Av: She said I/'ve had enough. Av: I am leave/ing you!

17) Putting It Together: Ordering & Formatting
- Start with header (+ lines), speaker identification ($Av/$P), and initial time marker "- 0:00".
- Transcribe utterances line-by-line with speaker codes (Av:/P:), applying:
  - C-unit segmentation rules
  - End-of-utterance punctuation
  - Pauses (: intra, ; inter) with durations when ≥ 2s, special handling for ~1.5–1.9s as above
  - Mazes () and [FP] for filled pauses; omissions (*, /*); unintelligible (X/XX/XXX)
  - Nonverbal {} placement and timing rules
  - Overlap <> and abandonment > as needed
  - Lexical/spelling conventions
- Conclude with final time marker "- X:XX".

Implementation Notes for Automation (for future development)
- Timestamp conversion: Convert Descript format [HH:MM:SS] to SALT format (- M:SS for time markers, pause codes for intervals).
- Detect and normalize speakers (Av/P) from source.
- Strip or map timestamps to pause codes where possible; round durations as specified.
- Apply conjunction-based segmentation (coordinate vs subordinate) with lexicon lists provided.
- Detect filled pauses from a whitelist (uh, um, hm, er, like, ah, etc.) and wrap in () with [FP].
- Identify mazes via repeated/revised starts; keep final intended form outside ().
- Preserve existing punctuation where correct; add . ! ? as required.
- Handle special codes: *, /*, X/XX/XXX, {}, <>, >, _, %, per rules above.

End of requirements.
